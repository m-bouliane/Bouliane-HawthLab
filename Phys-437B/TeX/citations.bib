@article{Ciccacci,
title = {Low energy electron gun for isochromat inverse photoemission},
volume = {53},
year = {1991},
abstract = {A very compact electron gun devoted to inverse photoemission spectroscopy is described in detail. The gun has been designed with the aid of ray-tracing analysis and then accurately tested. It produces an electron beam at variable energy with a small spot size and angular spread (less than 2 mm and 5°, respectively). Such performances are attained up to currents as high as 15 μA for the whole beam energy range (8–50 eV). A BaO cathode operating at a relatively low temperature is used as the electron emitter providing a low thermal energy spread.},
